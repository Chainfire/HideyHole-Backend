This is the Django backend (running on Google Cloud / Kubernetes) for the [Hidey Hole](https://github.com/Chainfire/HideyHole) app.

It's all relatively small and should be easy to follow for anyone with Django+GKE experience. No further docs
forthcoming, though you may find additional details in [Hidey Hole](https://github.com/Chainfire/HideyHole)'s repo.
