This is the Django backend (running on Google Cloud / Kubernetes) for the [Hidey Hole](https://github.com/Chainfire/HideyHole) app.

[LICENSE](./LICENSE) is GPLv3.

It's all relatively small and should be easy to follow for anyone with Django+GKE experience. No further docs
forthcoming, though you may find additional details in [Hidey Hole](https://github.com/Chainfire/HideyHole)'s repo.

UPDATE 2022/11/25:

This moved from GKE to a private K3D. This project is EOL, we're no longer running the cronjobs and finding
new images.
